ABSTRACT = {People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) need to monitor their blood glucose level frequently and use insulin to regulate it. T1D typically develops in young individuals and requires lifelong insulin injections for glycemic control. High or low blood glucose levels can lead to serious health issues. To address the challenges posed by regular monitoring and manual insulin injections, automated glucose control methods have been developed. Various insulin regimes are used to manage blood sugar levels, such as traditional regimes that involve one or two injections per day or multiple daily injection therapy, which offers more flexibility in the diet and dosage but still requires patients to monitor their carbohydrate intake and insulin injections. A proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is an automated glucose control method that is commonly used in commercial and research settings due to its simplicity and robustness. However, despite its effectiveness, this method can be affected by external factors like food, exercise, and illness. This study proposes to set an individualized observation frequency (OF) per user for the PID controller for blood glucose control in T1D. Optimizing the OF improves the PID controller’s performance, maintaining or elevating median glucose levels. Tuning the OF offers a simple and effective enhancement for the widely used PID controller.},
