title: Assembling of the final OBU for environmental monitoring
date: 2025-06-05
draft: false
abstract: "Final release of the new onboard unit has been assembled, programmed and successfully verified at the GIRTEL research group’s facilities. The new design includes a custom-made enclose, making the assembly more compact and resistant to outdoor environmental conditions thanks to the use of specific plastic material.
 
Onboard units are also ready to be coupled to different types of personal mobility vehicles as scooters and bikes since specific brackets for them have also been designed and manufactured. Each unit’s user kit also includes a small power supply with standard usb output, like that of a mobile phone, and a charging cable."
