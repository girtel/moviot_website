abstract: "Deployment of a small batch series of assembled onboard units is taking place in diverse personal mobility vehicles, such as scooters and bicycles, to check the right operation and robustness of the new units as well as to validate the complete solution.

Vehicles are driven by diverse University Staff taking advantage of their commutes to work and other trips around the city and data sent by units in real time using our specific IoT network, is being collected and processed on the project servers."
