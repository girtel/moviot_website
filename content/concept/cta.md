The MovIoT proof-of-concept proposes the prototyping of an environmental monitoring solution consisting of a necessary and significant number of measurement units equipped with sensorisation and IoT communications, and a set of data processing software modules. The hardware units will be developed to be installed in personal mobility vehicles, of the cycle or scooter type, and it is estimated that 10 units will be developed in order to have a sufficient critical mass of data collection for processing.

The MovIoT proof of concept aims to cover the following main objectives:

<ul>
<li>O1. To develop a prototype autonomous environmental monitoring unit equipped with LoRaWAN IoT communications for the collection and reporting of air pollution data, for installation and efficient operation in cycle and scooter type vehicles.</li>
<li>O2. Evolve an intelligent pollution data analysis microservice for geo-prediction of pollution values in future time.</li>
<li>O3. Evolve a web application for the visualisation of pollution and mobility parameters of sensorised vehicles.</li>
<li>O4. Integrate hardware/software developments into a monolithic environmental monitoring solution for administrations, micro-mobility companies and industry.</li>
<li>O5. Validate the functionality and performance of the solution, including scalability studies, web system response, IoT network reliability, measurement performance and unit autonomy.</li>
</ul>
